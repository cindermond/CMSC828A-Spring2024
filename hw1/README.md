# README for hw1 starter code

This starter pack contains four things:
1. A general requirements file that describes the environment you might want
2. A notebook with some huggingface basics in the cells (if you've used the library before, can probably skip)
3. A class sketch that might be inspirational for Part 2 if you go the "task-sampling" route for implementing weights in multi-task learning
4. (Purely for convenience) A copy of the three most relevant `no_trainer` scripts from the trasnformers library [pytorch examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch), 
which should give you _a_ possible basis for building the training and eval code you need for this assignment. These were copied directly from huggingface and only edit was commenting the `check_min_version("4.27.0.dev0")`.

We reserve the right to update this repo as well as to release additional hints and snippets if relevant or required. 
You can "watch" the repo to get notified if anything is pushed, but we will also announce any major update via ELMS and Piazza. 

However, we don't plan to update this unless necessary. 

Lastly sort of "no warranty" - we expect these snippets to all work, but this is just to help you get going, mostly if unfamiliar with the tools.
